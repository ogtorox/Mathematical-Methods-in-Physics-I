# Mathematical-Methods-in-Physics-I

These are the term proejcts completed Spring 2020 at the request of Dr. Carl Covatto for PHY 201: Mathematical Methods in Physics I at Arizona State University. The projects were completed in accordance of the course and in conjuction with three team mates, Jacob Harris, Junehyoung Jeon, and Neil Karerakattil.

The goal of this class was to prepare students for upper divison physics courses by teaching various math methods that are used in applied and theroetical physics studies. The course relies heavily on ideas found in Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. 

These projects should not be used for anything other than notes and refrences. They should not be used for re-publishing or re-dsitribution at any point in time without explicit written permission from all 4 authors.
